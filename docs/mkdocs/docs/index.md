# Welcome to PAIG

**PAIG** (Pronounced similar to *paige* or *payj*) is an open-source project designed to protect Generative AI (GenAI)
applications by ensuring security, safety, and observability. As the technologies and approaches for writing GenAI
applications evolve rapidly, PAIG provides a comprehensive framework to integrate and manage best-of-breed solutions
without the need to rewrite applications.

## Overview

PAIG is an extensible framework designed to implement security and safety in AI applications. It supports and integrates
seamlessly with a wide range of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vector Databases (VectorDBs), orchestrators, and other AI
tools. As the usage of GenAI evolves, the need for a robust governance framework becomes increasingly important. PAIG
addresses this need by providing a comprehensive solution.

The rapid evolution of technologies and approaches for writing GenAI applications is driving the need for robust
security and safety measures. New use cases are continually emerging, with users experimenting to discover new
possibilities. Despite advancements, there are still many unknowns in the realm of security and safety, necessitating
continuous improvement and adaptation. New tools are launched daily to address various aspects of these challenges,
often resulting in a fragmented landscape of point solutions. There is a need for flexibility to try out new tools
without rewriting applications, customizable solutions to meet specific needs, and future-proofing to ensure long-term
relevance. Comprehensive observability is essential to address security, compliance, and operational reviews.

## Features
