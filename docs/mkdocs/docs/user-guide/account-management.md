# PAIG Account and Subscription Management

PAIG's subscription management allows for flexible, transparent, and easy-to-understand pricing models. Whether you’re
an organization looking for a hands-on experience with our freemium offering, or a large enterprise seeking long-term
commitment, we have a model tailored for you.


### **Freemium Offering**:

- **No-Cost Trial**: Experience PAIG’s capabilities without a financial commitment.

- **User Limit**: The freemium plan includes access for the first five users, encouraging a joint exploration of our
  platform's offerings. If migrating to a paid plan, billing will include all active users.

- **Duration and Amendments**: While the freemium duration is indefinite, PAIG reserves the right to modify or conclude
  its provisions.

### **Self-Service Subscription**:

- **Autonomous Sign-up**: Customers can directly sign up on privacera.ai and choose their desired subscription tier. As
  we evolve, expect varied tiers with their unique feature sets.

- **User-Based Pricing**:
    - Please contact Privacera Sales for the latest pricing information.
    - Every user gets up to 100 checks daily, with one check consisting of a prompt and its reply.

- **Non-User Prompts (Public-Facing AI Service and Internal GenAI Tools)**:
    - Reach out to Privacera Sales for detailed information.
    - Clients are billed based on the actual number of requests made in a month.

### **Enterprise License Subscription**:

- **Customization and Discounts**: Catering to businesses seeking a tailored, extended partnership. Enjoy volume and
  commitment-based discounts parallel to our self-service model.

- **Charges and Deployment**: Offered annually, factoring in the number of users and non-user API calls. Reach out to
  Privacera Sales for detailed information.. You also get the option to deploy PAIG Shield within your Virtual Private
  Cloud (VPC).
- **Enterprise Features**: Some features are only available to enterprise customers. Please contact Privacera Sales for
  more information.

### **Defining User Count & Non-User API Requests**:

- **Active Users**: Calculated based on the peak number of users on any single day within a month. This includes
  everyone registered on the PAIG portal, from admins to regular users.

- **User Requests**: Interacting with an AI Application generally results in two calls to PAIG - one for the prompt and
  another for the response. Combined, they count as a single request. Each user has a daily limit of 100 such combined
  request checks.

- **Non-User API Requests**: Cater to external AI apps where individual users might not be involved or AI apps analyzing
  internal data. Here, every API call to PAIG, whether for a prompt or response, is an individual request.

- **Request Limitations**: Once a user or API reaches their maximum allowable requests, PAIG will deny further attempts,
  notifying that the set limit has been attained.
